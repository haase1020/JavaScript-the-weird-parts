# key words

1. syntax parser: a program that reads your code and determines what it does and if
   its grammer is valid.
   ->your code isn't magic. Someone else wrote a program to translate it for the computer.
2. lexical environment: where something sits physically in the code you write
3. execution context: a wrapper to help manage the code that is running.
4. name/value pair: a name which maps to a unique value.
5. object: a collection of name value pairs
6. hoisting: setup memory space for variables and functions.
7. all variables start as 'undefined'
8. single threaded: one command at a time (under the hood of the browser, maybe not).
9. synchronous: one at a time (and in order...)
10. invocation: running a function (in JS, by using parenthesis())
11. variable environment: where the variables live

## other notes

- you have "this" and "window" available in execution context (global) -> global object is window object called "this" -> at global level these 2 things are equal
- "global" means not inside a function
- execution context -> global object/ 'this'/ 'outer environment -> your code
