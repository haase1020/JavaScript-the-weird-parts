in JS, functions are objects!!!!

Big Word Alert:
1. first class functions: everything you can do with other types you can do with functions.
    -> assign them to variables, pass them around, create them on the fly.
    -> function (a special type of object)
        * primitive
        * object
        * function
        * name (optional, can be anon)
        * code 

2. expression: a unit of code that results in a value (it doesn't have to save to a variable)
3. mutate: to change something ('immutable' means can't be changed)
4. When a function is invoked:
 * new execution context is created (different from Window) and put on execution stack
 * each exec. cont. has variable environment, outer environment, and 'this'
 * 'this' points to another object/function

5. Whitespace: invisible characters that create literal 'space' in your written code
